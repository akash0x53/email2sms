The program 'email2sms' is written for those people who doesn't want
to miss those important emails asking to 'meet me at 2:30pm' when you
are having lunch at home and planning to take a small nap post-lunch
and does not have a smart-phone with you to intimate you about the
email. This little tool saves you, just keep it running in your lab
machine and you will be notified about emails as they arrive.

I don't really want to buy a smart-phone because all I use my phone
for is to make and receive calls.

This tool uses 160by2.com service to send you free sms. This is
written mainly to check gmail hosted email accounts as my official IIT
Ropar email address (@iitrpr.ac.in) is hosted with gmail.

Way2sms provides email to sms service but they don't send sms to DND
activated mobiles, and I don't want to deactivate DND and be disturbed
with all those caller tune calls.

This tool makes use of python-mechanize library, please install
mechanize python library to use this tool.
